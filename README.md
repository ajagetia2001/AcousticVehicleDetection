Abstractâ€”The detection and classification of vehicles on the
road is a very important task for Traffic Monitoring. Usually,
Computer Vision(CV) algorithms dominate the task of vehicle
classification on the road but CV methodologies might suffer
in poor lighting conditions and require greater amounts of
computational power. In contrast, acoustic traffic monitoring is
cost effective, and can provide greater accuracy particularly in
low lighting conditions and in places where cameras cannot be
installed. Most Machine Learning approaches consider the task
of vehicle detection (1 if a vehicle is detected and 0 if no vehicle
is detected) which is limited in its applications. In this paper, we
consider the task of acoustic vehicle sub-type classification where
we classify acoustic signals in 4 classes: Car, truck, bike and no
vehicle, with a focus on the harder task of distinguishing between
car and truck samples. Our proposed methodology improves
upon the established state-of-the-art baseline on the IDMT Traffic
dataset with an accuracy of 98.95%.
